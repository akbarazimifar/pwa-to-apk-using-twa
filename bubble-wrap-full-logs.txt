The application generated by Bubblewrap will open a Progressive Web App when
started from the Android launcher. Please enter the following details about
the PWA:

          Example: example.com

        - URL path: an URL path relative to the root of the origin,
          opened when the application is started from the home screen.
          Examples:

                - To open https://example.com/: /
                - To open https://example.com/path-to-pwa/: /path-to-pwa/

? Domain: chetanmishra8660.github.io

Android app details (2/5)

Please, enter details regarding how the Android app will look when installed
into a device:

        - Application name: the name used in most places,
          including the App information screen and on the Play Store.

        - Short name: an alternate name for the app, limited to
          12 characters, used on a device launch screen.

        - Application ID: also known as Package Name, this is
          the unique identifier for the application on an Android device or
          the Play Store. The name must contain at least two segments,
          separated by dots, each segment must start with a letter and all
          characters must be alphanumeric or an underscore (_).

        - Display mode: how the app will be displayed on the
          device screen when started. The default mode, used by most apps,
          is standalone. fullscreen causes the device status bar and
          navigation bars to be removed and is suitable for games or media
          players. For more information on the status bars and navigation
          bar on Android, go to:
           - https://material.io/design/platform-guidance/android-bars.html.

        - Status bar color: sets the status bar color used when the
          application is in foreground. Example: #7CC0FF

? Application name: Jaadu Jinn
? Short name: Jaadu Jinn
? Application ID: io.github.chetanmishra8660.twa
? Starting version code for the new app version: 1
? Display mode: standalone
? Orientation: default
? Status bar color: #2196F3

Launcher icons and splash screen (3/5)

The Android app requires an image for the launcher icon. It also displays a
splash screen while the web content is loading, to avoid displaying a flash of
a blank white page to users.

        - Splash screen color: sets the background colour used for the
          splash screen. Example: #7CC0FF

        - Icon URL: URL to an image that is at least 512x512px. Used to
          generate the launcher icon for the application and the image for
          the splash screen.

        - Maskable Icon URL (Optional): URL to an image that is at least
          512x512px to be used when generating maskable icons. Maskable
          icons should look good when their edges are removed by an icon
          mask. They will be used to display adaptive launcher icons on the
          Android home screen.

? Splash screen color: #FFFFFF

Optional Features (4/5)

        - Include app shortcuts: This question is only prompted if a
          'shortcuts' section is available on the input Web Manifest. When
          answered “yes”, Bubblewrap uses the information to generate
          shortcuts on the Android app. Read more about app shortcuts at
          https://web.dev/app-shortcuts/.

        - Monochrome icon URL: URL to an image that is at least 48x48px to
          be used when generating monochrome icons. Monochrome icons should
          look good when displayed with a single color, the PWA's
          theme_color. They will be used for notification icons.

? Monochrome icon URL: https://via.placeholder.com/48
? Include support for Play Billing (this relies on alpha dependencies)? No
? Request geolocation permission? No
